          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>We are a clothing label called VoeltijeDorp also known as Birds. our clothing label was inspired by the place we come from cause all of our street names are named after birds, for example: Flamigos, Blue Cranes, Red-knobbed Coot and many more.</p>
          <p>We really take pride in making this label a success because this would put our city on the map and would actually be something unique cause its something new and is some out of the box thinking. </p>
